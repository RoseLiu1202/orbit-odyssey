        <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                We as a species has been curious about the space since prehistoric times. From Mayans and Aztecs to Copernicus and Galilei, we have always been looking into the skies and
                wondering about what is out there. Since the 1950s and 1960s space exploration became a reality as our technology advanced, most notably the human landing on moon in 1969.
                However, modern space exploration—though groundbreaking—often feels less dramatic to the public. Mars rovers, the International Space Station (ISS), and telescopes like James Webb achieve incredible feats, but these missions don't have the immediate, tangible excitement of a Moon landing.
                While many people are aware of major events like starlink or Artemis I mission, most people don't really know what is ongoing with space exploration. Therefore, our project aims to create a web-based 3D experience that brings to life the rich narrative of space exploration since the human landing on moon in 1969 Using Three.js.
                We want to craft an accessible, immersive visualization that invites users to interactively explore and learn about space missions, highlighting our accomplishments over the past 55 years.

                    We were inspired by the 3D model of the solar system built by
                    <a href="https://www.solarsystemscope.com/" target="_blank">Solar System Scope</a>.
                    We thought their 3D interactive scene allowed users to visualize the scale, distances, and dynamics planets, which are things we aimed for.

                        Eyes on the Solar System built by NASA
                    </a> is also a very cool 3D visualization. We really like the tour animations, which show users the journey and trajectories of specific spacecrafts in a timeline.
                    We adapted their structure of having storytelling through text on one side and a 3d scene of space on the other side.

            <p>The original data was extracted from the Timeline of Space Exploration from Wikipedia which provides chronological information about key events in space exploration.</p>
            <p>The table format in the source was analyzed, and its structure was noted (e.g., columns such as Date, Mission Achievements, Country/Organization, and Mission Name)
            we manually counted the number of achievements in a given year as one of the entries. The data structure in JSON is the following:</p>
            <pre>
                {
                    "year": 1972,
                    "numberOfEvents": 5,
                    "countriesInvolved": ["USA"],
                    "discoveries": [
                        {"country": "USA (NASA)",
                        "missionName": "Pioneer 10",
                        "TechAdvance": "First spacecraft on a trajectory out of the solar system.",
                        "TechAdvance2": "First spacecraft to use all-nuclear electrical power (SNAP-19 RTGs).",
                        "Contact": "First spacecraft to enter the asteroid belt.",
                        "Contact2": "First spacecraft beyond the orbit of Mars."},

                        {"country": "USA (NASA)",
                        "missionName": "SAS 2",
                        "TechAdvance": "First orbital gamma ray observatory."}
                    ]
                },
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>We wanted to use a timeline (similar to the timeline in Assignment 2 the electoral map) to visualize the data at first. So we first used d3,
            and we wanted to create a timeline using SVG shapes like circle and lines. But we realized this has limited interaction as user would just be clicking on a year and
            see texts about a mission. In addition, it is not an aesthetic design with 55 circles in a row or column. Lastly, it does not show the pattern and trend of space exploration. Since we want to show the holistic trend of space exploration progress,
            we want to be able to see how the number of notable achievements fluctuates from year to year. Therefore, we decided to make a vertical bar chart, where the x-axis
            is the number of milestones and the y-axis are the years. To achieve this we used chart.js in our react environment to create an interactive timeline/bar chart.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="iterations">
        <h2>Design/Implementation Evolution</h2>
        <div class="content">

            <h3>Initial Brainstorm/Milestone 1</h3>
            <div class="image-container-vertical">
                <img src="static/process/ID.png">
                <img src="static/process/ID2.png">
                <img src="static/process/ID3.png">
            </div>

            <p>The initial design was focused on the trajectory of space rocket launches in each year. We imagined when user click on a year, they will be able to see a 3D animation of rocket launch.
            In addition, we wanted to show whether the space launch was successful or not, by highlighting the launch location green or red. The dataset that we were planning to use was a launch log of
                <a href="https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/data/derived/launchlog.html" target="_blank">all the spacecraft launched into space until current time</a>.
            and has the details about whether it was successful or not. </p>

            <div class="image-container-hori">
                <img src="static/process/milestone1.jpeg">
            </div>

            <p>Based on milestone 1 feedback, we realized that our design of visualization didn't answer our questions and also was incomplete. We then discussed and shifted our focus from visualizing the trajectory of spacecrafts
            and focus on the success and failures of individual spacecraft to notable achievements and milestones of each year. We reflected on our motivation and reconsidered our key questions. We then switched our data to the current one and redesigned the visualization</p>

            <h3>Milestone 2</h3>

            <div class="image-container-hori">
                <img src="static/process/milestone2.png">
                <img src="static/process/milestone22.png">
            </div>

            <div class="image-container-hori">
                <img src="static/process/timelime.png">
                <img src="static/process/detail.png">
            </div>

            <p>At this stage we wanted three main components in our visualization. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The timeline is color coded by country. Based on the feedback in class, we made the colors related to the countries they represent. For example, USA is blue and USSR is red.
                    Initially, we made tooltips to show up when hover over a year, and shows the country and the number of milestones in that year. However, later we decided that this information is already presented through
                    the legend and the axis, so we changed the hover state to trigger the detailed information on each milestone. We also added a clicked state for user to interact with the 3D solar system.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>3D Solar System:</strong> After building the 3D scene, we were considering how to connect it to the timeline so that it can show certain information. We initially plan to manipulate the camera position
                    to zoom out from Earth as space exploration expands since 1969. On top of that we wanted to animate the discovery of new planets by creating trajectory lines.
                    However, we didn't figure out how to make implement this. Therefore, to show expansion we decided to gradually light up the planets. </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Milestone Information:</strong> The most important part of our visualization are the milestones themselves. We want people to learn about the less known accomplishments in space exploration.
                    We wanted to display textual information in an aesthetically pleasing way without overloading the users with texts. Initially we had a side panel on the right dedicated to milestone information. However,
                    we thought it looked not interesting enough to attract people's attention. Therefore, we put the text in the center of the page instead and with vibrant colors. We also spent time choosing a futuristic and
                    space related color palette and font. In this version, each accomplishment will show up for ~30s and automatically change to the next one. We also thought it was a good idea to add a detailed view panel for
                    each planet, for people to learn more about a specific planet like Mercury. </li>
            </ul>
