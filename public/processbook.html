        <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Our project aims to create a web-based 3D experience that brings to life the rich narrative of space exploration over the past 2 years. Using Three.js and WebXR, we're crafting an accessible,
                immersive visualization that invites users to interactively explore space missions, highlighting the immense achievements and challenges faced by those who reach beyond our planet.
                Through engaging 3D graphics and VR-ready features, users will journey through key moments in space exploration history, witnessing the trials, failures, and triumphs that have driven humankind's quest to understand and expand our boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the final implementation, we combined interactivity, storytelling, and visual aesthetics to create an engaging user experience. The following components were implemented:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interactive Timeline:</strong> A vertical bar chart powered by Chart.js allows users to explore the progression of space exploration milestones from 1969 onwards. Each bar represents the number of milestones achieved in a given year, and the bars are color-coded by country (e.g., USA in blue, USSR in red). Users can filter data using an intuitive dropdown menu for country selection.

                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>3D Solar System Visualization:</strong> We used Three.js to create an interactive 3D solar system. As users interact with the timeline or explore specific years, planets gradually light up, visually representing humanity's expansion into the solar system.
                    <div class="image-container-hori">
                    </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic Milestone Cards:</strong> For every milestone, a detailed card appears in the center of the screen, providing mission-specific information such as mission name, technology advancement, and discoveries. Users can navigate between milestones using forward and backward controls.
                    <div class="image-container-hori">

    <section id="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Insights from the Data</h3>
            <p>Using the visualizations, we uncovered several insights about the progression of space exploration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There was a clear surge in space missions in the 1970s, primarily driven by the USA and USSR.</li>
                <li>The number of achievements declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but there was a resurgence in the 2000s with the contributions of new players like China and private companies.</li>
                <li>Modern milestones often focus on interplanetary exploration, deep space telescopes, and international collaborations like the ISS.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Effectiveness of the Visualization</h3>
            <p>Our visualization effectively addresses the key questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Notable Achievements:</strong> The milestones and interactive cards highlight key missions across decades.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Effort:</strong> Color-coded visualizations clearly showcase contributions from various countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Expansion into Space:</strong> The 3D solar system vividly represents the progression of humanity's exploration beyond Earth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations and Future Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>While the 3D solar system is visually impressive, the lack of trajectory animations limits the dynamic storytelling potential.</li>
                <li>We could improve the interactivity of the solar system by allowing users to zoom into specific planets and view related missions.</li>
                <li>Including real-time updates on ongoing missions (e.g., NASA or SpaceX data feeds) would enhance the educational value of the visualization.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overall, the final visualization successfully balances aesthetics, interactivity, and storytelling to engage users and promote a deeper understanding of space exploration.</p>
